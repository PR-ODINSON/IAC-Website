# IAC 2026 - Public Assets

## Images in this folder:

1. **logo.png** - Main Udgam 2026 logo used in the navbar
2. **iitram_logo_only.jpg** - IITRAM logo used as favicon
3. **iac-2026-cover.png** - Social media cover image for OG tags (PLACEHOLDER - Replace with actual cover image)

## Note for Deployment:

All files in this folder are served from the root path (`/filename.ext`) and are automatically copied to the `dist` folder during build.

For Netlify deployment, the `_redirects` file ensures proper routing for the React SPA.

## To replace the cover image:

Replace `iac-2026-cover.png` with your actual event cover image (recommended size: 1200x630px for optimal social media display).
